# triangles-coordinateSystem
The program first asks for how many triangles you wnat to create in the coordinate system (x, y)
Then, it asks the user to enter the location for each vertex of the triangle (like the x and y coordinate)
Eventually, the program calculates the perimeter, area and the length from the origin point to each point of the created triangle
